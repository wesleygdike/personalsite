  <p>A student, I spend hours a day reseaching and gaining knowledge of interesting technologies. I find great fulfilment knowing how the world around me is organized and operated. </p>
  <p>A creator, I love the challenge and the satisfaction of implementing what I have learned. The power to do is only limited to what you know as far as tech. is concerned. (And I don't plan to ever stop learning!)</p>
