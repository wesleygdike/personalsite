                            Complete darkness of a moon forsaken night broke in patches through the looming shadows of pines. Light scattered the sky in tiny pieces of a shattered sun giving nothing save shadows to the stone and trees about him. Wind sang chill whispers through pines and over rocks. He could not take side with whether the wind would help or hinder his hunt. Beasts to the past wind would hear her whispers of him, yet, whether beasts would flee or stalk he could not be sure.
                            The wind made no such whispers to him of what they saw in the darkness, he was left to his own. The other clansmen had long while past silenced with distance, swallowed in darkness of the moonless night. His feet had been left to find their way, guided more by instinct than sight. Ears strained to envision what sources brought strange sounds from the darkness. Fears taint had slowly burned with the night leaving ashes of peace as its embers died.
                            Half the night had past was best he could tell, a chill night of dark wandering, silent and still save for the wind. The ground had grew stony beneath him, rocks shifted under his weight and for brief moments muted the winds song with gritty tones. The time between rocks shifting began to draw out, his feet finding silent hold more often. The winds call grew district and clear in his ears, and the rocky shadows took more solid a form. He became curious, not quite sure of the sounds he himself made. He felt as though his mind had drifted from within himself to a distance past wind. As though  he were walking in two places at once, he knew his claws were soundless over the rocks as he stalked. His blood grew tense with power as he prepared his strength to close the now narrow gap.
                            Prock Tor gripped his axes tight in each hand as the cat stalking him lunged. The stone gave no comfort as he dropped to his side feeling the force of the large cat soar over his now grounded body. Stones skittered away as paws landed almost unaware on earth instead of flesh. Prock rolled to his knee raising his bronze headed axes as the cat lunged again. Claws dug deep into leather and skin along his upper arm, as he somehow knew they would, with all the power in him Prock brought down his remaining raised ax. Metal bit deep into bone as the weight of the cat smashed into his side.  A wild death snarl from the beast assaulted the dark night sky, echoing off the mountain side. Claws still imbedded in his arm convulsed and loosened giving way to blood as the weight of the beast settled atop him.
                            Relief coursed through him calming the pounding in his ears. The paws of the cat weakly shoved at the earth around him, it was as if the beast refused to die. Procks breath came in shuddered gasps and his fingers came way rigidly from the now deeply lodged ax. Warmth pulsed down his arm soaking his furred coat. Blood. He needed to stop the blood. His arm wriggled limply as he went to reach for his back roll. Prock frowned as a pain blossomed in his arm.
                            Now was a disheartening time to lose the strength in his arm. He would be expected to start moving the beast toward the firestone. Using his good arm Prock reached over his shoulder, wincing as sharp pain and disgust flared in his arm. Prock could feel flesh grit against flesh, the wounds were deep. Removing a short knife from his bundle he cut away a length of leather from its' outer edge. Replacing the knife Prock struggled oddly against his awkward hand and  leather piece trying with stiffening effort to knot the strip of pelt to his arm tight enough in position to stop, or even slow the blood. The pelt piece had become slick with blood, but after some angering moments the feat was done.  Almost proving more difficult than killing the beast, Prock thought as he wiped the blood from his hand on the still warm pelt of his prey. The flow of blood from his arm was now less but it would need to be burnt back at the firestone. Although Prock did not quite feel up to his one armed carry of the heavy cat, he reached under the front leg and hefted to the side. His shoulders bore the burdened limp mass of fur and mussel with determination as he took his first steps back the way he had come. More steps carried him ever closer, soon others would likely find him in the dark and lend aide. The night sky over head seemed darker somehow under his burden, his feet no longer moved by instinct but by will, often landing uneven causing additional effort to remain standing. The winds whispers had been replaced by deep gasping breath and blood pounding thick and strong in his head. Sweat came down his face and back making the night chill to his skin. The pain on his arm seemed to drench his thoughts as rain would a heavy fur, making each step a more difficult choice to remain standing. Yet, honor could be found in exhausted collapse, pushing himself to the edge of his strength. Setting his burden and waiting for others would do himself a grave disservice in the months ahead. Prock would be seen as week, and he nor his chief father would stand for such thought. No. No setting down his load. Thoughts wandered through his head as he trudged, a strange array of images and phrases, he became less and less aware of his load as the images and thoughts grew more present in his mind, until he felt sharp pain in his arm. The light that now shone in his eyes warped and danced as if looking at the rippling surface of a pond. These images took shape and then comprehension as his mind began to make sense of the faces and forms he now saw. Head rolling to the side and mussels straining against heavy weight holding him still, Prock sought to focus on the cause of the hot pain. A low red glow was withdrawing from his arm now burnt, sealing his wound. His body began to relax as Warmth soaked him from the nearby fire, while the light offered made clear the men around him who now loosed their grip of his arms and legs. He was lifted from the earth by the pits of his arms, strong hands clasp together over his chest as he rose. Prock lowered his head to ensure his legs were under him as he could only feel slight pressure in his legs as they held his weight. Prock Tors father adjusted his grip on his son as to hold Procks weight around the back of his neck by Procks unmutilated arm. A smile and hefty jolt his back reassured Prock of his fathers' feeling towards the outcome of the nights hunt. A howl of pride erupt as Tor clansmen saw Prock standing, Prock felt a smile on his face as he saw the cheers were given of him. He saw for the first time the beast he had killed by the light of the fire, which had grown in size since he awoke. The cat was impressive in size and the axe still buried in the bloodied skull seemed a grand testament of strength to him and his father. Emboldened, Prock withdrew his arm from his father and raised it to the gathered Tor. Another roar assaulted the night as the entire clan chanted the first of the ritual, Prock stooped to the beast empowered by the energy of the Tor around him he hefted his axe out and tossed it aside, gripping the front leg then reaching to grip with his other arm found it unable to lift the load. Prock paused for a moment, some nearby Tor clansmen seemed ready to come forward and lend aid. Before they could Prock twisted under the belly of the cat and raised the load once again to his back. Another roar from the clansmen gave Prock the needed encouragement to stand with the load. He stepped to the side of the now chest high flame, heat licked his face causing his eyes to tear. Hefting with his might the cat left his shoulders and bust in a bright rush of embers and smoke as it landed heavily on the fire. Prock back to the flames raised his good arm and his eyes to the night and as ritual demands claimed power over the strength of the night securing the Clansmen with the power to have success over those they faced until the night would grow black again. The Tor Chief again placed a stiff blow to his sons back showing his confidence in his sons strength to withstand contest.
                            The Tor chant continued as clansmen after clansmen threw their beasts of the night hunted in their own element down into the light of the flame claiming power over the night. None of the Tor had killed such large a beast as had Prock but there was a noticeable cheer when Deasen the son of a weaker Tor brought three serpents still writhing to the flame. There was violent hissing as the serpents flesh flamed and slowly blackened to death. The praise of Clansmen Emboldened Deason, he ran at the flame and the cheers cut off sharply. Deason stooped low at the flame and reaching out into its heat clasp one of the serpents now charred remains. Raising the burnt flesh over his head Deason backed from the flame crushing the bloody char over his head causing ash and hot blood to drench his face. Again the Tor around the flame roared in Deasons triumph, Deason roared back at the men. The clansmen lent Deason much strength as he, hands up raised, walked the edge of Tor holding his beast of the night high. The men gathered grew more and more riotous in Deasons display. Deason roared again as if in contest until his chest emptied, he inhaled sharp and ragged roaring again at the gathered clansmen. The men's cheers faded as they saw his fierce triumph change and distort. Deasons eyes searched as he turned from side to side, amid his roar came his father's name barely distinguished from his rasping out cries. A Tor arose from the crowd with a dark cast of anger shadowed by the light of the large flame. Deasons cry grew more distinct and full of rage. The clan went silent as father approached the clearing around his son and flame. Deason now sneering, repeated the name of his father, the tone of the sons voice carried death and craze.
                            "I claim!" Deason bellowed. "the life that gave me life, by my strength and by my power. It is mine! Let him refuse me!" Blood spat from Deasons face as the ceremonial words were spoken, a sentence of death to his father. The two men would fight until death of the weaker man in defense of the wealth and possession held by the father. Deasons father did not answer as ceremony would dictate, Deasons father Feyen Tor readied himself against his son bringing his axe before his grim expression. Deason also brought his bronze headed axe to the ready. Procks father had placed himself near the edge of the ring of gathered Tor clansmen. In a voice that would carry to the entire group Chief Troth Tor pronounced the trial begun a "May power rest upon the mighty and strong!"
                            Feyen watched his son, his eyes never taken from the younger man as Deason let roaring take hold of him again. Deason charged his father axe high, Feyen shuffled from foot to foot as his son came close prepared to catch the first axe swing. Bronze glittered in the flame light as it arched over Deasons head toward the shoulder of his father. Feyen stepped closer toward Deason catching the blow at his sons wrist with both hands dropping his own axe as he did so. Deason struggled against his father's grip to free his arm and weapon. Yet, Feyen grasped the wrist unfailing. Feyen pulled his sons wrist in front of him quickly his greater weight aiding his yank. Deason lost the tight grip that had held the axe in his own hand and the glimmering blade fell to the earth. Feyen twisted violently Deasons captive wrist held tightly to his side. Deason was torn from his feet by the force, the younger man was loosed mid twist the sudden freedom surprised him and he did not break his fall as he hit the ground and rolled from the force of the toss. Feyen rose to a crouch from the kneel his twist had left him in, quickly gaining atop Deason from behind as he began to stand. Feyen wrapped both arms around his sons neck and held his son as he struggled to breath. Deason failed his hands at his father's head, Feyen frowned in pain as Deason pulled at his father hair his hand came way which a yell of anger from Feyen as hair was torn from scalp. Feyen loosed the hold of one arm around Deason to fend off the attack of Deasons hands. Deason  stooped forward quickly with such force that Feyens hold was broken and his chin hit hard on Deasons back. Feyen stumbled forward a few steps as Deason fell to the dirt gasping in dust and air coughing up blood and bile. Feyen pulled a hand from his head were the missing hair had been torn out, blood covered his fingers from the open wound there. With a roar Feyen charged Deason who lay on the ground heaving breath, rolling to his back Deason kicked his father in the chest and face deflecting the force to the earth beside him. Deason pushed himself to his feat quickly throwing his self to his axe that had lain closer to the fire.  Feyen now stood crouched again facing his son who had begun smiling as he saw the fear grow in his father's eyes. Feyen knew his son was better with the axe and feared how such a fight would end. Deason took steps toward his father slowly as he regained his breath. Feyen dove from his crouch to tackle his son, but as he drew close Deason brought the axe down. The blow was misdirected as Feyen hit Deason with his shoulder to the gut. The axe gouged flesh from his father's  back as they hit the ground in desperation Feyen now atop his son brought both fists down, the blow sounded hollow against his sons face but the body was limp from the force and blood ran from openings in Deasons skin. Feyen allowed his body to collapse atop his son. Troth spoke the concluding words, "the life that gave, will take again."
                            Feyen shook his blood matted head. "No…. I will not." The voice was dry and weak, broken by heavy breaths. "Deason will live." Feyen struggled to kneel, "He will live, and I claim him as I claim a beast. He will no longer be my son, but my property." Troth looked down at the kneeling man. "That is not the way this is to end." "Unless you plan on killing one of us yourself this is how I end it." breathed Feyen as he stood. Troth frowned at the man, Feyen turned from him and gathered his axe from where it had first fallen. Then without looking back left the gathered Tor limping and snarling in pain.
                            Troth looked to Prock the flame light showing much in his father's face. Troth than turned  his look on the fallen Deason and then to those gathered and watching. "Night, take heed. We have hunted in your depths and have come to put down your greatest powers. By the might of our arm we will not fear you. But the remnant of your power will we gather your strength to us." With these words the nights ceremony was finished and the Tor dismissed. Troth turned and walked out of the group as others began to do the same. Proth watched the fire from where he sat, he tested his arm which had lost some of the burning. The limb moved painfully, it would be many days before he could use it fully.
